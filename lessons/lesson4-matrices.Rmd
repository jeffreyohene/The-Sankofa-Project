Matrices are like that cousin who you do not like but do not hate but at the
family reunion that's the one person you will hang out with if you had to
choose when your favorite cousin is wasted and long asleep.

We learnt previously that vectors are one-dimensional data objects in R that
store homogeneous data types but they are two dimensional, that is they contain
rows and columns.

As you will find out if you're going to do more algebra and advanced machine
learning operations, matrices are a very powerful data structure to work with
given because they are very efficient. I will shortly do a brain fuck by slightly explaining how this efficiency works. Matrices in R are stored in a computer's memory as contiguous blocks of memory, that is, elements of a matrix are stored one after the other in a computer memory making it extremely efficient for accessing elements in a sequential order. It is why in R, vectorized operations, operations that a
