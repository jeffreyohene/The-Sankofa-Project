# INTRO TO THIS BOOK

![](files/img/sankofa.png) 

So you want to learn R? Now, programming is
not easy. It is also not so hard.. What the hell is this guy on about?
You will understand some concepts very easily and some concepts will be
harder to grasp. Sometimes, some new concepts will be built on previous
ones you learned, so it is important to always pay attention to detail
and keep an open mind.

You will be face a lot of errors, your code won't work, at other times
even ChatGPT will not be able to give you good solutions to copy and
paste, you will want to punch your screen at times, other times maybe
just your keyboard or other times you might just want to throw your
laptop away,

Jeez, man, alright if this is something you are completely interested
in, let me give you the good news now. There is no feeling better than
writing a program that works as intended and runs perfectly. You feel
like THAT GUY! You run your code and look at that imaginary video camera
in the corner of your room like prime Michael Scott adÂ´nd feel wow I
really am that good?

![](files/img/gifs/surprised.gif)

When you're a developer, on some days, you're gonna feel like a genius,
other days you're gonna feel like a complete idiot that doesn't know
jack-[redacted].

Anyone can learn to code, you can learn how to write lines of code for
long enough and convince yourself and/or if you're like me everyone else
that you are good. The point of coding is to be able to use your code to
solve actual problems. The very little concepts you learn, how do you
intimately understand them, how do you assemble, like LEGO pieces, bits
and lines of code to build functional programs. Programs that do actual
stuff. That is the point of being a developer: building things. You do
not want to be like Tottenham Hotspur and always build stuff but never
actually know how to wIn StUfF... sorry, have a point for building what
you build.

At this point I would personally advise you, yeah, no, seriously that
this journey of learning how to code will be fun, it will be ugly; for
some code challenges, you will be staring at your screen at 4 AM
wondering if it is worth it.

"Jeff??? Are you convincing me to code or not?" Don't worry I am trying
to make sure you understand that, this is no easy path to tread and if
you start learning to code half-heartedly, you most likely are not going
to make it eventually. I am not kidding when I say you need to try to
read or write code for 30 minutes to an hour at least everyday or if
you're like me and enjoy the weekend away from electronic devices,
during the weekdays.

## CODING? WHAT IS IT

Simple, coding is the art of writing instructions in a programming
language to build something called a program. There are so many
programming languages out there: C, JavaScript, Rust, Java, HTML, CSS,
PHP, SQL, etc.

You will notice we left one popular programming language out: Python.
Honestly if you ever make it to the end of this course, one of the
requirements is for you to be a full time Python hater and troll people
online for saying it is better than R! Don't do that seriously lol...
Python is another versatile programming language which is popular for
it's equally readable syntax and ease to learn. But in terms of
statistical computing and/or programming, if you ask the old gods and
the new, they will tell you R is way better.

Back to coding now. You notice how we talked about coding being the art
of writing instructions that will be executed by a computer to create a
program or an application? That is the point of coding, so the
programming language converts your code into instructions your computer
can understand and your computer processes your code for you building
the program you wrote code for. Computers understand only binary
language to process your code, in layman's terms as Joey Tribbianni
would say: goo-goo-gaga!

Binary is just 1s and 0s and each programming language you learn
compiles your code into machine readable code that allows the computer
to run it and give you a program. No kidding computers are fast, no,
like really fast and unlike you who is unprepared to do a monotonous
task continuously for even 10 minutes, a computer can do that for longer
without complaining. They can perform complex calculations, store huge
amounts of data, perform repetitive tasks, something you and I cannot
keep up.

## What does a programmer do?

Because I do not want to get cancelled, as it's an ick for my crush, I
will not start a war on specifying what and who these categories are and
the inevitable question of which is better(I cannot say that it is
developer).

If you are going to code, especially if you are starting out, you are
going to be building a lot of things from scratch. You are going to put
together lines of code here and there to build programs. You are also
going to actually test those programs to see if they actually run well
and in the inevitable scenario that your code fails to do what you built
it to do, you are going to become a code doctor(wow, that might be a
good username) and perform the most dreaded task of programming, the
part where the mighty tremble and fail the part where you scan through
lines and do not see where the problem is: DEBUGGING.

You're probably going to do more debugging as you go farther in your
programming journey. Initially, you're going to be doing a lot of
building and testing and then when parts of your code do not work,
you're going to have to debug. Simply put, debugging is the process of
finding and resolving errors or if you're cool, finding and removing or
resolving bugs in your code. Now we're not going to be getting rid of
bugs with insecticide as we do not want to get cancelled by the
wonderful insect-rights community, so removing bugs is just fixing your
code to work in an expected way.

It happens to even me but most of the tie, bugs are inevitable, your
code works today or a line or few lines of code you stole from
StackOverflow worked perfectly but you fire up your computer the next
day and you get an error everytime you run your code again.

You start panicking, you tried to fix it how best you thought could be
fixed but it's still not working. Well first of all, be me because
contrary to popular belief, I do not actually know what a sTaCkOvEfLoW
is...

![](files/img/stackoverflow-8.jpg)

To be honest debugging is an art. You will need to understand errors. In
this course, we will take the counter intuitive approach. Instead of
fearing errors and panicking when your code does not work, you will be
invigorated whenever your code throws up an error. You dear madam or
kind sir will become the bane of errors.

![](files/img/darkness_bane.jpg)

Nothing dramatic, but one of the big aims of this course is to make you
comfortable with errors. Errors are simply ways of telling you the logic
in your code is flawed and they test your knowledge of concepts and also
your application/implementation of that concept in your code. The good
thing you will find is, with time you will become a better programmer
over time because of the mistakes you have made in the past. This course
will oddly encourage you to make mistakes as they help you consolidate
what ever loose piece of knowledge you have in your head.

Now we will move on to the next chapter where we talk more about R and R
programming and its importance and why we are going to learn it.
