Vectors are like the Swiss army knife of data structures. Almost every
data structure can be built with vectors.

Here are the main things you'd need to know about vectors:

-   they are one dimensional
-   they can only store homogeneous data types

When we say vectors are one-dimensional, it means they are structured in
a single line or sequence. To get a better picture of this, you know how
tables for example are two-dimensional because the data they contain are
structured in rows and columns, vectors aren't like that. They are one
dimensional meaning they contain data in a single sequence.

Vectors can store a wide range of data types but there is a catch, you
can only stored that particular data type. This is the homogenity
characteristic of vectors. In plain and simple english, if you store
numeric data type in R, that vector can only contain numeric data, same
goes for integer, character and boolean data types.

In R, to create a vector, you can use the `c()` function. The `c` means
combine or concatenate.Let us see an example of a vector now.

```{r}
# create a vector of numbers
vec <- c(1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6)

vec
```

Voilà, we created a vector with numbers. We can create a vector
containing other data types let us try character and boolean data types.

```{r}
# Vector of names of Friends
friends <- c("Monica Geller", "Rachel Greene", "Joey Tribbiani",
             "Phoebe Buffay", "Chandler Bing", "Ross Geller")

friends
```

```{r}
# A vector of booleans
bool <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

bool
```

We have seen how vectors are created. Do you remember how we said
vectors are supposed to be homogeneus? Shall we attempt to mix data
types and see if it works?

![](files/img/gifs/mischief.gif)

```{r}
# Mixed vector
mix <- c(7, 5, "Morty", "Rick", 9)

mix
```

This works but in R there is something called expected behavior, I would
like to point here. You remember how the `c()` function concatenates or
combines elements? When the elements are not of the same data type, this
function coerces all the elements into separate strings. Let us see how
this works but before, in R, to check the type of an object, you can use
the function `class()`.

```{r}
# Mixed vector
mix <- c(7, 5, "Morty", "Rick", 9)

class(mix)
```

## Other ways of creating vectors

Although we gave created vectors using the combine function, we will
learn other common ways of creating vectors.

### The `:` operator

In R when you use the colon operator, it creates a sequence of numbers
from the first number on the right hand side to the left hand side.
Don't get too twisted, this is going to be simple.

```{r}
# Create a vector of years from 2000 to 2010
years <- 2000:2010

years
```

Now time to test your hands on this. Create a vector of numbers from 100
to 107 and assign to a variable called `vec`.

```{r, ex="vec1", type="sample-code"}
# Create a vector of numbers from 100 to 107

```


```{r, ex="vec1", type="solution"}
# Create a vector of numbers from 100 to 107
vec <- 100:107
vec
```

```{r, ex="vec1", type="sct"}
test_object("vec")
test_output_contains("vec <- 100:107;vec", incorrect_msg = "Make sure to print `vec`.")
success_msg("Successful!")
```

![](files/img/gifs/approve.gif)

Bien fait. Monica Geller approves!

### The `seq()` function

Sometimes we want to generate a sequence of numbers but not exactly in a
regular sequence. This is where the seq() function comes in handy. We
can use it to create a vector with a specified start, end and an
increment value.

```{r}
# Creating a sequence from 1 to 10 by increments of 2
vec1 <- seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2)

vec1
```


Your turn! Create a sequence of vectors of multiples of 3 from 3 to 36 and
assign it to `v1`.

```{r, ex="vec2",type="sample-code"}
# Sequence from 3 to 36
```

```{r, ex="vec2",type="solution"}
# Sequence from 3 to 36
v1 <- seq(from = 3, to = 36, by = 3)
v1
```

```{r, ex="vec2",type="sct"}
test_object("v1")
test_output_contains("v1 <- seq(from = 3, to = 36, by = 3); v1",
                     incorrect_msg = "Make sure to print `vec`.")
success_msg("Successful!")
```

### The `vector()` function

We can create a vector by using the, you guessed it, `vector()`
function! This function creates a vector of a specified length and data
type.

```{r}
# Create a vector with the vector function()
num_vec <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = 10)

num_vec

```

This type of creating a vector is very handy and we will see why when we
learn about loops and conditional statements.

<br>

## VECTOR OPERATIONS

Remember how we performed some operations with the data types we
learned? Vectors are next level. In fact learning how to work with
vectors will make you understand a lot about how R does things in the
background when you call some operations on other data structures. We
can perform arithmetic operations on numeric and integer vectors,
perform logical operations on any type of vector and the most important
secret I will disclose before is, in R when you call any descriptive
statistic function, R most likely treats that data you supplied as a
vector in the background. Real swiss-army knife huh?

Let us take a further look at what we're talking about.

### Arithmetic Operations

When you have a vector which is of numeric or integer type, you can
perform arithmetic operations on that vector. Addition, subtraction,
division, multiplication, etc. Right now seated behind my laptop typing
this, I would probably add a piece of advice I already did when we
talked about arithmetic operations on data types. When you are
performing arithmetic operations in R, always remember that the rules of
BODMAS or PEMDAS. Later, I will show you an example of how ignoring this
can introduce bugs into your program.

Let's go and arithmetic operate deez vectors!

```{r}
# Addition
vec1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
vec2 <- c(10, 3, 5, 1, 12)

vec1 + vec2
```

How does R do this? When you call an arithmetic operation on two
vectors, R initially checks if these two vectors are of the same length
and then it adds each element at the same position in both vectors. For
example the first element in `vec1` is added to the first element in
`vec2`, and the process is repeated for each element in the vector.

You do notice how we said R initially checks to see if the two vectors
are of the same length? In theory, when performing arithmetic operations
with two vectors, it is recommended to ensure the vectors are of the
same length. You do remember our dear old friend, Mr. Expected Behavior?
Not paying attention to him can lead to unintended behavior in our code,
a very common source of bugs.

![](files/img/gifs/bug.gif)

```{r}
# Define a vector of unequal lengths
v1 <- 1:5
v2 <- 10:13

# Subtract v1 from v2
v2 - v1
```

So you noticed R coughed up a result for us but produced a warning that:
`Warning: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length`

This is because we tried to perform an arithmetic operation on two vectors of
unequal length. R is of course happy to cough up a result for you but look
closely at the result printed after the warning, it is a vector of length 5
elements. Quick tip: in R, you can use the function `length()` to check how
many elements are in a vector.

Let us go over our previous code once again and dissect it further. You
remember how we said we will me comfortable and learn to understand errors and
warnings instead of panicking when we see them? This is one of those times!

```{r}
# Define a vector of unequal lengths
v1 <- 1:5
v2 <- 10:13

# Print vectors
v1
v2

# Subtract v1 from v2
v2 - v1
```

Let us now change the elements in both vectors and make one vector longer than
another to see something very strange.

```{r}
# Define two vectors
a <- c(20, 40, 60, 80, 100)
b <- c(50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500)

length(a)
length(b)
```

We can see from the above code that our first vector has 5 elements while our
second has 10 elements. Let us perform a subtraction operation on these
vectors. We will subtract b from a and save it to a variable to print later

```{r}
# Define vectors a and b
a <- c(20, 40, 60, 80, 100)
b <- c(50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500)

# subtract vector a from b
c <- b - a

# print c
c
```

In the result produced from subtracting those vectors, we see something
interesting. R produced the resulting vector `c`. Why doe we now have modified
elements although vector `a` ran out of elements? What R does in the background
is this:

```{md}
a: 20 40 60 80 100
b: 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500

b - a: 50-20 100-40 150-60 200-80 250-100 300-20 350-40 400-60 450-80 500-100  
```

You will notice that, after the last element in a was reached, R started over
the vector a till it matched the length of vector b to ensure the operation was
complete. Why is this? This behavior is because, when R is performing an
arithmetic operation on two vectors of unequal lengths, it recycles every
element in the shorter vector till it matches the length of the longer vector.
This is unintended behavior if you are not specifically performing an
operation that mimics this. So when you define two vectors to perform an
arithmetic operation on them, always ensure they are of similar lengths to
avoid introducing unintended behavior into your code.

Time for you to do some vector operations yourself. In the next two code
chunks, define two vectors, x and y, where vector x is a vector with elements
from numbers 8 to 14 and vector y contains elements from 3 to 9. In the first
code chunk multiply x by y and in the next, divide y by x save both results
to a variable called z and print it out.

```{r,ex="vec3", type="sample-code"}
# Define vector x and y



# Perform multiplication and save to z


# Print z

```

```{r,ex="vec3", type="solution"}
# Define vector x and y
x <- 8:14
y <- 3:9

# Perform multiplication and save to z
z <- x * y

# Print z
z
```

```{r,ex="vec3", type="sct"}
test_object("x","y","z")
test_output_contains("x <- 8:14;y <- 3:9;z <- x * y;z",
                     incorrect_msg = "Did you assign the variables correctly?.")
success_msg("Successful!")
```


```{r,ex="vec3", type="sample-code"}
# Define vector x and y



# Perform multiplication and save to z


# Print z

```



### Indexing

This might be one of the most handy R concepts you might learn from this
course. Indexing is a pretty valuable concept to understand. Indexing in
vectors refers to the process of accessing individual elements or subsets of
elements within a vector. The syntax for indexing in R with vectors is using
the square-bracket notation: `vector[index]` and specifying the index of the
element or elements you want to extract. It is important to also state that,
while other programming languages indexing starts at 0 (LUNATICS!), in R, like
the sane people we are, indexing starts at 1.

In R, indexing allows you to retrieve specific elements from a vector based on
their position or index within the vector. We will learn about 3 types of
indexing methods for this lesson and they are:

- single & multi element indexing
- logical indexing
- negative indexing

Now I left another type of creating vector out specifically so we can talk
about it in this sub-lesson

#### Single & Multi Element Indexing

To extract or access a single element in a vector, you use square brackets and
then supply the index of that element. If you are working with a named vector
however, you only need to supply the name of that element.


Let us see single element indexing in motion.

```{r}
# Define a vector
years <- 2000:2008
years

# Extract 2004
year_2004 <- years[5]
year_2004
```

Simple! We supplied the number 5 and then we were able to index the year 2004.

```{r}
# Capitals
capitals <- c("Accra", "Berlin", "Nairobi", "Paris", "Lisbon")

# Extract Paris
france_capital <- capitals[4]
france_capital
```

Try your hands on the next single indexing activity below.

```{r}
# Fruits vector
fruits <- c("mango", "avocado", "banana", "pawpaw", "kiwi", "watermelon", "grape")

# Extract watermelon to a variable named worst_fruit and print it


```

Wow we did it together. If you really in anyway enjoy eating watermelon, kindly take a break immediately and take a long hard look at yourself in the mirror.

![](files/img/gifs/sgame.gif)

Now that we have completed our daily fruit-shaming activity, let us move on to
multi-element indexing. Sometimes you want to extract more than one element
from a preexisting vector. How do we do that? We can do something called
negative indexing which we will learn about later but wherever possible in your
code, it is generally recommended not to alter elements you will reuse later,
so instead of deleting elements which negative indexing does, we will extract
what we need and save to a new vector. Going back to our fruits vector, let us
say we want to extract the top 3 fruits of all time.

```{r}
# Fruits vector
fruits <- c("mango", "avocado", "banana", "pawpaw", "kiwi", "watermelon", "grape")

# Index best fruits
goat_fruits <- fruits[1:3]
goat_fruits
```
You noticed here we used our old friend the colon operator. The colon operator
is not just used to create vectors you can also use it to specify a range to
index a vector with. It is very handy when you want to generate a consecutive
sequence and use that sequence to index a vector but sometimes, just sometimes,
you would want to index elements in a vector that are not in a consecutive
sequence. I know by now you're saying what the hell is this guy on about but
stay with me. Let me show you an example quickly, we shall use our fruit
vector once again

```{r}
# Fruits vector
fruits <- c("mango", "avocado", "banana", "pawpaw", "kiwi", "watermelon", "grape")

# Index mango, banana, kiwi and grape
new_fruits <- fruits[c(1, 3, 5, 7)]
new_fruits
```
See there, we used a vector to index another vector. But this time, because the
elements were not at consecutive indices, that is, indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
and so on, we had to supply the indices of the elements we wanted to extract as
a vector to be able to subset those elements.

You remember the `:` operator we used to subset the best fruits of all time?
Using that was a shortcut and we could have also used a vector to subset the
those fruits like this

```{r}
# Fruits vector
fruits <- c("mango", "avocado", "banana", "pawpaw", "kiwi", "watermelon", "grape")

# Index best fruits
goat_fruits <- fruits[c(1, 2, 3)]
goat_fruits
```
This worked too. We did not use the colon operator but we were still able to
subset the same elements. You will find that in R, there are numerous ways to
solve a problem and the selection of a solution for any problem or task you may
encounter is dependent on that specific task.

#### Logical Indexing


Logical indexing in R refers to the process of using logical vectors to subset
or extract elements from a data structure based on a given condition.

So in indexing a vector with a logical vector, you need to first create the
condition you want to subset for then use that logical vector to subset the
initial vector you want to index to extract only elements that meet the 
specified condition.

```{r}
# Create a vector
vec <- c(54, 10, 21, 30, 40, 12, 98, 50, 85, 13)

# Create a logical vector indicating which elements are greater than 30
logical_vector <- vec > 30

# Use logical indexing to subset elements greater than 30
subset_vec <- vec[logical_vector]

# Print the result
subset_vec

```




### SUMMARY STATISTICS

![](files/img/gifs/summary.gif)


Summary statistics are numerical values that summarize and describe features
of a range of values. They provide insights into the characteristics and
distribution of the data. For this lesson we will talk about mean, median,
mode, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and variance. You will be performing
summary statistic operations mostly on dataframes but in the background R
treats this columns you will try to derive summary statistics from so we will
see how to do that. We will do a lesson on summary statistics and its
applications in R from a theoretical and then a practical point of view but
this section will talk we will serve summary statistics as an entrée (I'm
fresh of my daily french duolingo lesson lol).


#### Mean

The mean is the average value of a set of given values. It is calculated by 
adding up all the values in the given set of numbers and then dividing by the
total number of values in that distribution. The function to do this is:
`mean()`.

Let us see how to calculate the mean of a given range of values in R. The data structure we will use in this lesson is vectors.

```{r}
# Create a vector of numbers
vec <- seq(from=1,to=21, by=3)

# Calculate the mean of vec
mean(vec)
```

Perfect! We were able to calculate the mean of vec and we got the answer 10.
This is how you calculate the mean. Try your hands on calculating the mean of a 
vector called `v1` which contains a sequence of numbers from 28 to 50. You can
use the colon operator to create this `v1` and calculate the mean.

```{r}
# Create a vector named v1 thuat contains numbers from 28 to 50


# Calculate the mean of v1

```

```{r}

```

#### Median

The median is a measure of central tendency that represents the middle value of
a given set of values when that set of values is ordered from the least to the
greatest. In R, when you call the median function, the rearrangement from 
least to greatest value is automatically performed in the background. Cool, no?

There is a little thing I would like to include here. If the length of the
range of values that the median is being calculated for is odd, the median will
be the middle value however if the range of values is an even number of values,
the median is the average of the two middle values. 

![](files/img/gifs/math-hmm.gif)

If this confused you, you definitely hate math but hold on, I will show what 
this means in an example below.


```{r}
# Create a vector with an odd number of values
odd_values <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

# Check length of odd_values
length(odd_values)

# Calculate the median
median(odd_values)
```

In the example above, the vector `odd_values` has 7 values as printed by the
result of the `length()` function called on `odd_values`. So the median is
going to be the middle number of the set of values of the vector `odd_values`.

Let us see another example with a range of values whose length is even.

```{r}
# Create a vector with an even number of values
even_values <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)

# Check length of even_values
length(even_values)

# Calculate the median
median(even_values)
```

So what R does here is simple. Since the vector `even_values` has 8 elements in it, the median cannot be the middle value since technically we have two middle values in this set of values. What happens is, R will add these two middle values together and divide by the count of these numbers, which in this case is 2. In other words, R calculates the average of the middle values so in the background, the two values in the middle of `even_values`, 4 and 5 are added and divided by the count of these values which is 2. This is what happens mathematically the sum of 4 and 5 divided by 2 becomes our median value.


#### Mode

The mode refers to the value that occurs the most in a distribution. If you visualize a histogram, this value will represent the peak of the distribution. R does not have a built-in function that calculates the mode of a distribution. But you can use the `table()` function to calculate the most recurring value in a distribution.

```{r}
# Create a vector v1
v1 <- c(1, 5, 9, 9, 17, 5, 13, 9, 9, 3, 1, 9)

# Tabulate most recurring value
table(v1)
```

Voilà! We can find that from our v1 vector that the most recurring values is 9.
The `table()` function in R is used to create contingency tables of the counts
of categories. Do not worry about it so much now as we will discuss it in
further detail in latter lessons. But also a spoiler: in a latter lesson about
functions you will create a function that calculates the mode of a given
distribution.

#### Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion or spread of a set of values 
around the mean, indicating how much values in a given distribution deviate
from the average. A larger standard deviation implies greater variability or
spread of the values, while a smaller standard deviation suggests less
variability or tighter clustering of the values around the mean.

In R you can calculate the standard deviation of a range of values by using the
`sd()` function. Let us see that in action.

```{r}
# Create vector
vec <- c(44, 87, 56, 32, 77, 25, 61, 50, 10)

# Calculate the standard deviation of vec
sd(vec)
```

#### Minimum and Maximum

The minimum is used to refer to the minimum or smallest value in a given
distribution while maximum refers to the greatest or largest value in a given
distribution.

In R, in the most unimaginative way as possible, the functions to calculate
the minimum and maximum values in a given distribution are `min()` and `max()`
respectively. As always, let us see an example of this.

```{r}
# Create vector
x <- c(5, 9, 98, 23, 2, 22, 65, 99, 87, 35, 17)

# Find the highest value in vector x
max(x)

# Find the smallest value in vector x
min(x)
```

For our vector `x`, the smallest value was 2 and the highest value was 99.


#### IMPORTANT

For calculating summary statistics, there is one very important detail you
should note. In R and in real life, more often than not you will encounter
missing values or undefined values in distributions. In R, these values are
represented by NA, which is short for Not Available. 

When calculating any summary statistic, it is recommended to initially check if
that range of values contain NA values. We will get to that shortly but I want
to show you what happens when you try to calculate a summary statistic when
there are NA values present in the data that you are working with.

```{r}
# Vector containing NA values
a <- c(12, 4, 3, 17, NA, 20, 19)

# Calculate mean
mean(a)
```

Running this code chunk above gives you a mean of NA, which isn't right. Now
imagine you had data and variables that you wanted to report on the mean or
median or standard deviation for and you get an NA value, that is not so
practical is it. This is R's default behavior with handling missing values but
I will also like to point out the importance of this behavior. R does this to
ensure missing data is not inadvertently ignored or treated as zero as this
can potentially lead to misleading results in data analysis. You would have to
explicitly supply an extra argument known as `na.rm` and set it to `TRUE`. R
will then remove the missing values before computing the summary statistic, in 
our case, the mean. Let us quickly do this below.

```{r}
# Vector containing NA values
a <- c(12, 4, 3, 17, NA, 20, 19)

# Calculate mean
mean(a, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Now the mean is calculated correctly for us. This applies also to functions
like `median()`, `sd()`, `max()`, `min()`. 

The question that is probably lingering behind the back of your head is how do
you check if a vector has NA values. You can use a function called `is.na()`. 

This function however will return a vector of logical values which is prints
true or false for each element stating whether it is an NA value or not.
See how this works.

```{r}
# Create vector containing NA values
a <- c(12, 4, 3, 17, NA, 20, 19, NA)

# Check if a has missing values
is.na(a)
```

So this functions returns a logical vector and the elements of this logical
vector specifies whether the element in the vector you are checking for NA
values in is an NA value or not.

Now if you have a really large vector with a lot of elements this logical
vector will return a lot of values which may be a little difficult to manually
scan each element of the output of this logical vector to determine if there is
a TRUE value before you conclude there are missing values in the distribution
you're working with. This is where I teach you another R function that makes
your life easier: the `any()` function. Let's look at how it works with the
same vector

```{r}
# Create vector containing NA values
a <- c(12, 4, 3, 17, NA, 20, 19, NA)

# Check if a has missing values
any(is.na(a))
```

This returns just one value that specifies if there is any NA value present in
the distribution you are working with and you know whether to supply a value to
the `na.rm` argument when computing a summary statistic.
