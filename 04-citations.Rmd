Data types are the fundamental building blocks of almost every program
you will ever write in R. They define the data type a object can
contain and as an effect the types of operations that can be performed
on that objects.

In R, we have four main types of data and they are: - Numeric (num) -
Integer (int) - Logical (logi) - Character (chr)

`Numeric` data types are data types that are either whole numbers like
10, 3, 78, 90, 55 and 7, or decimals like 3.14, 7.5, 49.7, 3.3334, 0.5
and 123.2245. You will see this data type represented by the
abbreviation `num` in R.

`Integer` data types refer to data types that are whole numbers, and do
not have a decimal point like -5, 45, 33, 7, 9 and 67. They are usually
represented with an `L` at the end so, `7L` is an integer data type.
They are represented by the abbreviation `int` in R.

`Logical` or `boolean` data types represents truth values, either `TRUE`
or `FALSE`. Logical data types are used for comparisons and conditional
statements in R and are represented by `logi`.

`Character` data types are used to refer to text, string or alphanumeric
data in R. They are represented by `chr`.

Do note that, whenever you are working with text data, you need to wrap
it inside single or double quotes for R to understand you are working
with a character data type else R will throw up an error.

You remember when you typed in your first line of R code in the console
and hit enter it printed your name? Try typing your first name but this
time, do not wrap it in quotes. Just literally type your name in the
console and hit enter.

R should throw up an error like `Error: object ... not found`. Why? This
is because in R whenever you do not wrap a string or text in quotes, it
reads it as an object and it will throw up an error because it was
unable to find that object.

This leads us to the last part of this lesson on data structures,
interactive examples. But before we need to learn one more concept for
this lesson.

You notice whenever you type in a data type, try typing in a numeric,
logical or character value in the code chunk below. Notice that it
prints the value and then that's it, it disappears?

This behavior is not so helpful in R programming. Sometimes we need to
store data and then use it later on in our code. This helps make our
program neater.

Enter variables! In R, a variable is a named storage location that holds
data, and its value can be changed or updated during the course of a
program. Variables are fundamental for storing and manipulating data in
R. When you assign a value to a variable, you are creating a reference
to a specific location in memory where that value is stored and you can
use that value by referencing the variable name.

In R, the syntax for assigning a variable is simple:
`variable_name <- value`

Where `variable_name` is the name of your variable and `<-` is the
assignment operator in R and `value` is the value being assigned to that
variable

Think of a variable as a container for storing different objects.
Supposing we have a container that has cookies, we label the container
as cookies. We have another container that stores pencils, we label that
as pencils and another that stores water, we can label that as water. So
what happens is, each container stores a quantity of something, in
programming we refer to that as variables. Let us say we have 5 cookies
in the cookies container and we have 10 pencils in the pencils container
and we have just water in the water container. We can represent that
programatically like this:

```{r}
# Define variables
cookies <- 5
pencils <- 10
water <- "water"

# Print variables
cookies
pencils
water
```

When we print our variables, voila! We still have them stored safely for
us. We can decide to change the values the variable contain and it will
update for us and we can have the new values available for us in our
code.

In R, I would in fact discourage from hardcoding values as much as
possible. Try to store values in variables so you can have them
accessible later on in your program. This helps a lot with debugging and
when you figure out something is wrong, you only need to update the
value you assigned to the variable and your code will run as normal,
this helps you avoid updating every instance of the value if you
hardcoded it.

Try to live up to the famous words uttered by John F. Woods that says:
"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a
violent psychopath who knows where you live."

Always strive for readability.

Let us now truly start playing with what we've learned.

### Numeric & Integer Data Types

We want to assign and print different numeric data types

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=500}
# Numeric data
half <- 0.5
pi <- 3.14
length <- 7.5

half
pi
length
```

We assigned and printed numeric data types. Let us see the same thing
with an integer too. Integers, if you remember are whole numbers. Let us
create 3 variables with names of 3 kids: Abena, Kofi and Yaa and assign
their ages to these variables

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=500}
# Define variables
abena <- 10
kofi <- 17
yaa <- 12

# Print variables
abena
kofi
yaa
```


Time to try interactive hands on coding! In other words, GET SCHWIFTY!!

![](files/img/gifs/schwifty.gif)

Let us dial it back down to primary school. You have 2 pens, 3 pencils, an eraser, and a sharpener. Can you code these values below and assign them to their respective descriptive variables? 

Remember to assign all of the values to their respective variables and then print them.

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=500}
# Write your code here


```

#### Basic Numeric and Integer Data Type Operations

We can perform arithmetic operations with numeric and integer data types in R.

The operators for performing these operations are the same ones you learnt back in school. 

![](files/img/gifs/or.gif)

HAHA just kidding. Arithmetic operators are similar in R, with some slight
differences for some operators.

- `+`: addition
- `-`: subtraction
- `*`: multiplication
- `/`: division
- `%%`: modulus (remainder for division)
- `^`: exponent

Instead of regular `x`, in R you use the asterisk operator, `*`, to perform
multiplication and the `/` to perform division. Modulus is used to find the
remainder of a division operation.

`IMPORTANT`: the order of operations in mathematics, BODMAS or PEMDAS, depending on where you are coming from, still holds true in R


We will not go through the really basic operators like addition, subtraction, division and multiplication in the following examples we will see how the modulus and exponent operators works in R. 

```{r}
# Perform modulus and exponent operations
x <- 27
y <- 3

# Modulus
x %% y

# Exponent
x ^ y
```
Perfect! So as we already know, 27 divided by 3 leaves no remainder and also, 27 raised to the power 3 is 19,683. This is how to use the modulus and exponent operators. But before, I would like to see you try to use them so you feel comfortable with it.

```{r,tut=TRUE,height=500}
# Define two numeric/integer values and perform the modulus and exponent operations

```


Perfect we now know how to perform arithmetic operations in R. Now let's get a
little lazy. 

So if you took my advice, it is always easier in R to perform operations if you do not hard-code values. It makes your code easier and you can perform operations with your variables even more easily.

Let us take a random scenario for example: say we wanted to calculate the area of a triangle in R. We know the formula for finding an area for finding the area of a triangle is:

Area = 1/2 * Base * Height

Supposing we had a triangle with a base of 15cm and a height of 23cm, let us calculate its area!

```{r}
# Calculate area of a triangle
base_in_cm <- 15
height_in_cm <- 23

# Perform calculation
area <- 0.5 * base_in_cm * height_in_cm

# Print area
area

```

Great! Our area is 172.5 centimetres! If we had a new triangle with base and height to be 8cm and 12 cm respectively, we only need to update the `base_in_cm` and `height_in_cm` variables and we will still get the correct answer.

```{r}
# Calculate new triangle area
base_in_cm <- 8
height_in_cm <- 12

# Perform calculation
area <- 0.5 * base_in_cm * height_in_cm

# Print area
area
```

48 centimeters! Our code still run without any error. If we typed the values
directly in our code and supposing there were numerous instances where we
needed to use those values in our code, we would have to update each and every
single one of them.

Remember we learnt it is recommended to always avoid hardcoding when possible?
In our triangle example, we could have assigned the value 0.5 to a variable and
use it in our code, but for the area formula for triangles, it is a constant so
we can leave it like that. If you want to be really neat about this when you
have numerous instances and do not want to hard-code, you can assign it to a
variable if you so desire.


The area of a rectangle is expressed as:

`Area = l * w`,

where l is the rectangles length and w is its width. 

Now given a rectangle of dimensions 10cm and 4cm length and width respectively,
can you calculate the area of this rectangle below?

```{r}
# Write your code below

```


### Character Data Types

We can perform numerous operations with character data in R. You will see this referred to as strings also. Strings sounds cooler so let us use this term for the purpose of this lesson!


We will learn some basic string operations and then try our hands on a couple of examples.

#### String Operations in R

We will learn about five string operations and they are:

- Concatenation
- String Length
- Changing character case
- Trimming whitespace
- String interpolation


`Concatenation` refers to joining two strings together. In R, we can use the
`paste()` function.

```{r}
# Define firstname and lastname
first_name <- "Monica"
last_name <- "Geller"

# Concatenate first and last names
full_name <- paste(first_name, last_name)
full_name
```

Yes and now we have the full name of every man's dream woman all around the globe, thank you!


We can also check for the number of characters or length of a given string with
a function known as `nchar()`

```{r}
# Define 3 strings
greeting <- "Hello there"
sentence <- "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy fox"
empty_string <- ""
not_empty <- " "

# Print length of all 3 strings
nchar(greeting)
nchar(sentence)
nchar(empty_string)
nchar(not_empty)
```

Before we discuss what happened up there, in R you can define an empty string
by typing two double quotes without leaving space in between the quotes. If there
is whitespace between the two double quotes, R interprets the whitespace as a
character and this behavior is very important to understand as in R, `"Jones"`
and `"Jones "` are not the same string. We will bring this concept up again
later when we talk about checking for equality in R.

Back to the code chunk above. We can see that, R counts whitespace as a
character when we are checking for the length of a script. Our code returned
the length of different strings supplied to it, 11, 43, 0 and 1. Strings are
not always one word or two, they can be long sequences of text and in R, we can
always find out the length by using the `nchar()` function


`Changing cases` in R referes to converting a string to all lower or upper
case. The respective operations can be performed by using `tolower()` and
`toupper()`.

```{r}
# Change the cases of the following strings to lower
name <- "LIONEL MESSI"
bikini_bottom <- "sPoNgEbOb SqUaRePaNtS"

name <- tolower(name)
bikini_bottom <- tolower(bikini_bottom)

# Print updated strings
name
bikini_bottom

# Convert them to upper case and then print
name <- toupper(name)
bikini_bottom <- toupper(bikini_bottom)

name
bikini_bottom
```

Very straightforward! These functions convert your strings to lower and
uppercase. It is useful to note that, these functions will convert all
alphabetic characters in your string.

Trimming whitespace refers to removing leading and/or trailing whitespace in a string. In R, we can do that with the `trimws()` function like this:

```{r}
# Define fruit variable
fruit <- "mango             "

# Trim whitespace
trimws(fruit)
```
The function removed the trailing whitespace for us. What if there was leading and trailing whitespace? Can we trim that too? Of course!

```{r}
# Define a variable and assign a value
artist <- "  rihanna badgalriri  "

# Trim whitespace
trimws(artist)
```
That worked too! The function by default trims leading and trailing whitespace by default and has extra arguments if you want to do some more advanced, you know, trimming. In R, to find out more about how to use a function, highlight said function and press F1 to view the function documentation.

Finally, we can perform a little bit of magic which may have gotten us in hot water if were at Salem back in the day. Just kidding this is not as impressive but we will talk about string interpolation. You remember how we said variables are important because they allow reuse later in our program? This might be a very good graphic illustration to see how that works.

Supposing we have a program that takes in a user's name and age and for example we have Bob who is 16 years old, says: "Happy Birthday, Bob, you are sixteen years old today!", We can do that in R like this

```{r}
# Define user details
name <- "Samantha"
age <- "twenty-two"

message <- paste("Happy Birthday,", name, "you are", age, "years old today!")
message

```
And that is basic string interpolation using `paste()`. We can interpolate as many variables into a string as we want but be sure we do that if we only need to. Interpolation is a dynamic way to work with strings so we do not have to keep defining variables over and over again. If for example our complex program which performs interpolation finishes saying happy birthday to Samantha and it gets a new input, all it needs to do is update the input with the new name and age and then just print it.

Change the name and age below to your name and a theoretical age and then run the code to check if it works as expected. Remember to type the age in words.

```{r}
# Define user details
name <- ""
age <- ""

message <- paste("Happy Birthday,", name, "you are", age, "years old today!")
message

```








I have to say here that, the biggest advantage and disadvantage in R is, you 
can mostly do what you like. You can be flexible and use whatever "legal" 
method works for you but once you do not understand concepts enough to apply
them, your implementation becomes flawed and you introduce bugs into your
program. So inasmuch as you can be flexible when writing your code, always make
sure you are implementing solutions correctly. Failure to do this is a common
source of errors when programming in R.
