# Welcome to The Sankofa Project

![](files/img/sankofa.png)

Sankofa is a beautiful word in Twi which translates into: "Go back and get it".
It is associated with a symbol which embodies the idea of looking back to the
past to learn from it and move forward. In the context of this course, it will 
represent for us continuous learning and growth, using past learned concepts
to build our skillset in programming.
